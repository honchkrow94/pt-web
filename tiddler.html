    <p class="tidds" style="font-size:25px;text-align:center;">So, you've heard what that Tart Fred has to say about me. You think you know me?! Well, everything he says may be the truth, but that's only one side to this lovable little troublemaker!<br>I mean, who could say no to this face?</p>
    <img src="https://i.ibb.co/XXTvyhs/20190628-075421-1.jpg" height="350px" width="250px" overflow="hidden"alt="Wheet! The close up daddy took that time I was well behaved for a change. I'm adorable, of course, but he didn't tell me he was taking the shot so he got my bad side! Bad Guinea Daddy!" />

    <p class="tidds" font-size="20px"color="white">So, what is it about me that makes me such a naughty, playful guinea? Is it being born and bred in Coventry? Is it spending my first six months of life growing up with an older guinea, before he went to the hayfield in the sky? Is it because that tart Fred is near my age and such a stuck up, stuffy guinea, so the temptation to play him up is there?
    <br>
    <strong>Who knows!</strong>
    <br> I CAN tell you more about me though!
    <br> I'm a smooth guinea with claws of steel and a heart of gold, but only to the wrong person! I moved to Big Guinea Daddy's house two years ago, and boy was I bricking it! I didn't make any noise for HOURS! But as soon as I saw my adopted older brother Fred, the rumbles of domination were quick to follow!
