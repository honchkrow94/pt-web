    <p class="tidds" style="font-size:25px;text-align:center;color:#F5E191;font-family:lacquer;">So, you've heard what that Tart Fred has to say about me. You think you know me?! Well, everything he says may be the truth, but that's only one side to this lovable little troublemaker!<br>I mean, who could say no to this face?</p>

I'm adorable, of course, but he didn't tell me he was taking the shot so he got my bad side! Bad Guinea Daddy!" border="0" />

    <p class="tidds" style="font-size:22px;color:#F5E191;text-align:center;font-family:lacquer;">So, what is it about me that makes me such a naughty, playful guinea? Is it being born and bred in Coventry? Is it spending my first six months of life growing up with an older guinea, before he went to the hayfield in the sky? Is it because that tart Fred is near my age and such a stuck up, stuffy guinea, so the temptation to play him up is there?
      <br><br>
      <strong>Who knows!</strong><br>
      <br> I CAN tell you more about me though!<br> 
    </p>
    <br><br>
    <p class="tidds" style="font-size:22px;color:#F5E191;font-family:lacquer;"><br> I'm a smooth guinea with claws of steel and a heart of gold, but only to the wrong person! I moved to Big Guinea Daddy's house two years ago, and boy was I bricking it! I didn't make any noise for HOURS! But as soon as I saw my adopted older brother Fred, the rumbles of domination were quick to follow!
    <br> Not that there were any female guineas to fight over, but that's never stopped me! 
    <br><br> I like running through thick clumps of hay, and making little nests in them to have lots of naps. I also like veggie treats, and will meercat up to meet mommy when she dangles something delicious above me. I've recently found my (very squeaky) wheet, too!
    <br><br> I also have a dark secret - I've tasted meat... and I like it! Wheet! That's right, I took on Big Guinea Daddy and LIVED! But it came with the price of constantly craving steaks and kebabs. Check out my damage below!! I did good!</p>

    <br><br>                                                                                                                                             
    <p class="tidds" style="font-size:22px;color:#F5E191;font-family:lacquer;"In all honestly, underneath it all, I love it here! I have a family who loves and cares for me, who feed me when I'm ill, hold me close and sing to me! (I love Elton John - check out the recorded adventures page for Big Guinea Daddy's singing!) And although it may not seem like it, I really love Guinea Fred, which is why I want to play ALL THE TIME WITH HIM!
    <br><br> There is so much more to me than the Guinea pig you see. I've lived through many experiences, and I hope I live more!!
