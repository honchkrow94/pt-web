    <p class="tart" style="font-size:25px;text-align:center;"> New Human! whEEEET!! <strong>Guinea ID sniffing</strong> Okay, i'll allow!<br> Welcome to my Biography! Unike Tiddler, I don't bite! I'm a friendly, fluffy guinea who loves cuddles and licking human faces for the salt content!Here's some pictures of me to show you how affectionate I am!</p>

    <p class="tidds" style="font-size:22px;color:#F5E191;text-align:center;font-family:lacquer;">So, what is it about me that makes me such a naughty, playful guinea? Is it being born and bred in Coventry? Is it spending my first six months of life growing up with an older guinea, before he went to the hayfield in the sky? Is it because that tart Fred is near my age and such a stuck up, stuffy guinea, so the temptation to play him up is there?
      <br><br>
      <strong>Who knows!</strong><br>
      <br> I CAN tell you more about me though!<br> 
    </p>
    <br><br>
    <p class="tidds" style="font-size:22px;color:#F5E191;font-family:lacquer;"><br> I'm a smooth guinea with claws of steel and a heart of gold, but only to the wrong person! I moved to Big Guinea Daddy's house two years ago, and boy was I bricking it! I didn't make any noise for HOURS! But as soon as I saw my adopted older brother Fred, the rumbles of domination were quick to follow!
    <br> Not that there were any female guineas to fight over, but that's never stopped me! 
    <br><br> I like running through thick clumps of hay, and making little nests in them to have lots of naps. I also like veggie treats, and will meercat up to meet mommy when she dangles something delicious above me. I've recently found my (very squeaky) wheet, too!
    <br><br> I also have a dark secret - I've tasted meat... and I like it! Wheet! That's right, I took on Big Guinea Daddy and LIVED! But it came with the price of constantly craving steaks and kebabs. Check out my damage below!! I did good!</p>
